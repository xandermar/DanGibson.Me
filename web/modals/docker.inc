<p>Docker is a platform and tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of its dependencies (such as libraries, frameworks, and other software) into a single standardized unit for deployment.</p>
<p>Here are some key concepts related to Docker:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Containers</strong>: Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. They isolate the application from the underlying system and ensure consistency across different environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Images</strong>: An image is a read-only template that contains the instructions for creating a container. It includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and other dependencies. Images are used to create containers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dockerfile</strong>: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, the dependencies to be installed, and other configuration settings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Containerization</strong>: Containerization is the process of encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Engine</strong>: Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that enables container management. It consists of a server daemon (dockerd) and a command-line interface (docker CLI) that allows users to interact with Docker.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Compose</strong>: Docker Compose is a tool that allows users to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file. It simplifies the process of defining and orchestrating complex applications composed of multiple containers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications by providing a consistent and portable environment across different platforms and environments. It has become a popular choice for DevOps teams and developers looking to streamline their development and deployment workflows.</p>
