<p>Angular is a popular open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of developers. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Key features and concepts of Angular include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Component-based Architecture</strong>: Angular follows a component-based architecture where the application is composed of reusable and modular components. Each component encapsulates its own logic, HTML template, and styling, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Two-Way Data Binding</strong>: Angular provides two-way data binding, which means that changes to the application state (model) are automatically reflected in the user interface (view) and vice versa. This simplifies the process of keeping the UI in sync with the underlying data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that allows developers to inject dependencies (services or other objects) into components and services. This promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability by decoupling components from their dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Routing</strong>: Angular includes a powerful routing module that enables developers to define navigation paths and manage application routing. It supports features such as nested routes, route guards, lazy loading, and parameterized routes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Client</strong>: Angular provides an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to servers and consuming APIs. It supports features such as request and response interception, error handling, and observables for handling asynchronous data streams.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Forms</strong>: Angular includes a forms module for building and validating forms in web applications. It supports both template-driven forms and reactive forms, providing flexibility and control over form handling and validation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Directives</strong>: Angular introduces directives, which are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular&#39;s HTML compiler (part of Angular&#39;s rendering engine) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or transform the DOM element and its children.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: Angular provides built-in support for testing applications using tools like Jasmine and Karma. It includes utilities for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure the reliability and quality of Angular applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Angular is a comprehensive framework that offers a rich set of features and tools for building modern web applications. It is widely used by developers and organizations to create dynamic, interactive, and scalable applications across various industries and domains.</p>
