<p>Drupal SimpleSAMLphp Authentication is a module used in Drupal to integrate SimpleSAMLphp with Drupal&#39;s user authentication system. SimpleSAMLphp is an open-source implementation of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, which enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication across multiple applications and systems.</p>
<p>When SimpleSAMLphp Authentication is installed and configured in Drupal, it allows Drupal sites to authenticate users against a SAML identity provider (IdP), such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Okta, OneLogin, Shibboleth, or other SAML-compatible systems.</p>
<p>Key features of Drupal SimpleSAMLphp Authentication module include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>: Users can log in to Drupal using their credentials from the SAML identity provider, eliminating the need for separate usernames and passwords for each application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Federated Identity</strong>: Drupal can act as a service provider (SP) in a federated identity management system, relying on the SAML identity provider for user authentication and attribute assertion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User Attribute Mapping</strong>: Administrators can configure mappings between attributes received from the SAML identity provider and Drupal user profile fields, allowing for automatic population of user profiles with SAML attribute data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning</strong>: New user accounts can be automatically created in Drupal when users authenticate via SAML, using information provided by the identity provider.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customizable Authentication Flow</strong>: Administrators can customize the authentication flow, including options for redirecting users to the identity provider for authentication, handling authentication errors, and specifying logout behavior.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Drupal SimpleSAMLphp Authentication module provides a seamless integration between Drupal and SAML identity providers, enabling organizations to leverage existing identity management systems and provide a unified authentication experience for users across their applications and services.</p>
